The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly causing unexpected results.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a `width` property of an element that is floated or absolutely positioned may not produce the expected result because of how the containing element computes the available width.  Another less obvious issue involves using `calc()` with units other than pixels, percentages, em, rem, etc.  Mixing incompatible units (like pixels and ems within one calculation) can lead to unexpected behavior or rendering errors.
